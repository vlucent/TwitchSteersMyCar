#Twitch Steers - HackUMBC F2016

This project was created at HackUMBC Fall2016 event.
We were inspired by the [Twitch Plays Pokemon]
(https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon) stream.

The project involves the control of an off-the-shelf Remote Control toy car 
using commands typed in the chatbox of the [twitch stream]
